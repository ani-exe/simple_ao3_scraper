He wants to spend time with his brother, walk home hand-in-hand with his crush, and be a respectable employee for his teacher-slash-boss.Instead, it seems the universe has decided that his second year of high school was the best time to make his boring life interesting. He\u2019s been growing apart from his brother, his crush has a tag-along that seems to despise him, and something is awakening under the sleepy belly of Seasoning.Oh, and he\u2019s haunted.
